# Strip-Adjustment-with-Matlab
 Strip alignment (also known as strip adjustment) can help improve the consistency between several adjacent UAV-LiDAR flight lines. Strip alignment workflows utilize algorithms which align the LiDAR point clouds from one strip to another without necessarily knowing the source of the error.

### the code include: ###

1- image matching and finding tie points //
2- Relative Orientation triangulation // 
3- absolute Orientation with 3D conformal and M34 method
