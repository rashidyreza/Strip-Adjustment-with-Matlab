# Strip-Adjustment-with-Matlab
 Strip alignment (also known as strip adjustment) can help improve the consistency between several adjacent UAV-LiDAR flight lines. Strip alignment workflows utilize algorithms which align the LiDAR point clouds from one strip to another without necessarily knowing the source of the error.

### the code include this functions: ###

1- Image matching and finding tie points

2- Relative Orientation triangulation

3- Absolute Orientation with 3D conformal and M34 method

4- You can also choose different matching method or orientation method to run the code

### Run STRIP.m to see the results (you need to check the data directories
